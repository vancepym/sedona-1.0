<p>
Sedona is a software framework designed to make it easy to build
smart, networked embedded devices.  Some of the Sedona highlights:
</p>                                                              

<ul>
<li><b>Sedona Language</b>: This is a general purpose component oriented 
programming language very similar to Java or C#.  The Sedona language 
is used to write your own custom functionality.</li>

<li><b>Sedona Virtual Machine</b>: The Sedona virtual machine is
a small interpreter written in ANSI C and designed for portability.  It
allows code written in the Sedona programming language to be written
once, but run on any Sedona device.  The VM itself is designed to be
highly portable to new microprocessors and operating systems.
</li>                         

<li><b>Java Support</b>: The Sedona compiler also generates standard 
Java bytecode which allows you to run all your Sedona code on the 
Java VM too.</li>

<li><b>Small Devices</b>: Sedona is targeted to be run in very small 
embedded devices - Sedona applications can be run in under 100KB of memory!
</li>

<li><b>Component Oriented Programming</b>: Sedona enables a style of
programming where prebuilt components are assembled into applications.
Components can act as services or be explicitly linked together to 
create data and control flow.  This model is especially suited to
graphical programming tools.</li>

<li><b>Networking</b>: Several protocols are bundled with
Sedona to provision, program, and communicate with Sedona-enabled devices over various 
network topologies.  You can remotely add, remove, and modify the components 
in your application in real-time.  You can even upgrade the firmware itself
over the network.  All Sedona networking is designed to work over any
IP network including <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN'>6LoWPAN</a>.
</li>

<li><b>Open Source Ecosystem</b>: The core Sedona technology is licensed
under a flexible academic styled license.  This makes it easy for manufacturers
to Sedona enable their devices.  Tools and applications written in Sedona 
are guaranteed portable to any Sedona device. 
</li>

</ul>
